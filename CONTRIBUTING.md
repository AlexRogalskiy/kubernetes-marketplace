# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Civo Kubernetes Marketplace! To ensure consistency and quality of applications available on the marketplace we have prepared this guideline document. It details the criteria for acceptance into the marketplace, maintenance requirements and responsibilities for applications, and measures we may take concerning submitted applications if issues are discovered.

### Acceptance Criteria

In general, we will approve all Marketplace applications for inclusion, as long as they add an element of functionality not provided by other applications, and have been tested to work on the default version of k3s deployed on the creation of a new cluster on Civo.

To submit an application to the Marketplace, make sure you include all the required information specified in the README.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

As a submitter of an application, you will also become its maintainer. As a maintainer, your responsibilities will be to:
- Monitor the upstream version of your submitted application for updates and submit pull requests to update the application's version when appropriate
- Respond promptly with a decision and feedback to pull requests from other users to your application on this repository
- Notify Civo if you wish to step away from the maintainer role for your application

### Vulnerabilities and Other Concerns

We may remove an application from the Civo Marketplace with no notice if a severe vulnerability is discovered. Other reasons for removing an application are, but are not limited to:
- An application becoming abandoned or unmaintained by the upstream project
- An application becoming abandoned or unmaintained by the submitter
- An application becoming deprecated by another service or application
